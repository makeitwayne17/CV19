# CV19 - CSE276d
COVID19 is an ongoing, global pandemic, stretching healthcare resources and systems to their limits. TV-CV19 is an ongoing effort aimed at addressing the shortage of healthcare providers and ventilators, both of which are necessary for effective treatment.  

## Overview
The TV-CV19 project is a web application that provides  healthcare workers and volunteers with a simple-to-use interface to track and manage their patient populations, and a universal ventilator controller that interfaces with the plethora of makeshift ventilators being designed by teams around the globe.

## Targets
 - a minimum viable product (MVP) version of the TV-CV19 app.  
 - allow the app for the interfacing of clinicians, nurses, and volunteers to monitor patients and communicate 
 - integrate universal ventilator controls(tentative)
 
## Team
 - Bryant Liu 
 - Jeremy Ford
 - Many more people not part of the course
